# CodeAlpha Python Internship Projects

This repository contains two Python projects developed during my internship at CodeAlpha:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: A simple program to generate Fibonacci numbers.
2. **Voice Assistant**: A Python-based voice assistant that listens to your voice and performs various tasks.

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with Python and apply fundamental concepts to real-world applications.

**Project 1:** Fibonacci Generator
**Location:** FibonacciGenerator/fibonacci.py

**Description:**
 This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a number specified by the user. It handles invalid input and properly accounts for the numbers 0 and 1.

**How to Run:**
**1. Navigate to the FibonacciGenerator folder:**
   cd FibonacciGenerator
**2. Run the program:**
   python fibonacci.py

**Project 2:** Voice Assistant
**Location:** VoiceAssistant/VOICEASSISTANT.py

**Description:**
**A Python-based voice assistant that listens to your voice and responds with actions such as:**
Searching Wikipedia
Opening websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
Telling the current time
Telling programming jokes
Opening Notepad (Windows only)

**How to Run:**
**1. Navigate to the VoiceAssistant folder:**
   cd VoiceAssistant
**2. Run the program:**
   python VOICEASSISTANT.py
**3. Install the necessary dependencies:**
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3

**Once the dependencies are installed, run the script, and the voice assistant will begin listening for commands such as:**
"Search Wikipedia"
"Open Google"
"Tell me a joke"
"Tell the time"
"Open Notepad" (Windows only)

**Technologies Used:**
Python **3.13.3**
speech_recognition (for voice recognition)
pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech)
wikipedia (for Wikipedia searches)
webbrowser (for opening websites)
time (for getting the current time)
os (for opening Notepad on Windows)
